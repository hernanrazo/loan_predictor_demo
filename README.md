Loan Prediction Demo
===

Description
---
A python program that predicts whether or not a loan applicant will get approved. Data includes gender, marital status, income, education level, and many other criteria. This program takes this information and makes a prediction as to whether or not the applicant is eligible for a loan. This problem is part of the [Loan Prediction Practice Problem](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-loan-prediction-iii/) at the Analytics Vidhya website.  

Analysis

First, we can make a few graphs to visualize the data and see what we might have to manipulate later on.  

First make a histogram and boxplot of applicant income. 

![applicant Income histogram](https://github.com/hrazo7/loan_predictor_demo/blob/master/graphs/appIncomeHist.png) ![applicant income boxplot](https://github.com/hrazo7/loan_predictor_demo/blob/master/graphs/appIncomeBoxPlot.png)  

We can see there are a few extreme values. These values can still be valid due the applicants having high income variations. So to get a better picture, split applicant income by education levels.
